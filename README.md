# Insurance Cost Prediction
## 1 Project Goal:
The main aim of the project is to predict the Insurance Cost of the people in the United States of America within different regions with the help of specific attributes. Since Insurance Cost varies from one individual to another and it depends on different features, we will try to find correlation between the features and insurance cost charges.

## 2 Dataset
Columns:
This dataset is a collection of 7 attributes/features out of which 6 features help in predicting the charges of Insurance Cost for an individual. The detail of each attribute is as follows:
</br>● age: age of primary beneficiary.
</br>● sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
</br>● bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
</br>● children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
</br>● smoker: Smoking
</br>● region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest,
northwest.
</br>● charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## 3 Methods
Below are some potential regression methods we see ourselves using in this project:
</br>● We are planning on doing Exploratory Data Analysis of the data and try to find answers to questions via visualization and analysis.
</br>● We will use Forward selection and Backward elimination processes to model and will try to emphasize the difference in methodology of both processes.
</br>● We will also compare different regression models and use the best model to predict the Insurance Cost.
